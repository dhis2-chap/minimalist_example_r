# Minimalist example of R model integration with CHAP 
This document demonstrates a minimalist example of how to write a CHAP-compatible forecasting model. The example is written in R, uses few variables without any lag and a standard machine learning model. It simply learns a linear regression from rain and temperature to disease cases in the same month, without considering any previous disease or climate data. It also assumes and works only with a single region. The model is not meant to accurately capture any interesting relations - the purpose is just to show how CHAP integration works in a simplest possible setting. 

## Running the model without CHAP integration
Before getting a new model to work as part of CHAP, it can be useful to develop and debug it while running it directly a small dataset from file. 

The example can be run in isolation (e.g. from the command line) using the file isolated_run.r:
```
RScript isolated_run.r  
```

This file only contains two code lines:  
* A call to a function "train", which trains a model from an input file "trainData.csv" and stores the trained model in a file "model.bin":
```R
train_chap("input/trainData.csv", "output/model.bin")
```

* A call to a function "predict" uses the stored model to forecast future disease cases (to a file "predictions.csv") based on input data on future climate predictions (from a file futureClimateData.csv):
```R
predict_chap("output/model.bin", "input/trainData.csv", "input/futureClimateData.csv", "output/predictions.csv")
```


### Training data
The example uses a minimalist input data containing rainfall, temperature and disease cases for a single region and two time points ("traindata.csv"):
```csv
time_period,rainfall,mean_temperature,disease_cases,location
2023-05,10,30,200,loc1
2023-06,2,30,100,loc1
2023-06,1,35,100,loc1
```

### Training the model
The file "train.r" contains the code to train a model. It reads in training data from a csv file to a data frame. It learns a linear regression from rainfall and mean_temperature (X) to disease_cases (Y). The trained model is stored to file using saveRDS:
```
train_chap <- function(csv_fn, model_fn) {
  df <- read.csv(csv_fn)
  df$disease_cases[is.na(df$disease_cases)] <- 0
  model <- lm(disease_cases ~ rainfall + mean_temperature, data = df)
  saveRDS(model, file=model_fn)
}

```
### Future climate data
A minimalist future (predicted) climate data is provided in a file "futureClimateData.csv". This file contains climate data for what is considered to be future periods (weather forecasts). It naturally contains no disease data):  
```
time_period,rainfall,mean_temperature,location
2023-07,20,20,loc1
2023-08,30,20,loc1
2023-09,30,30,loc1
```

### Generating forecasts
The file "predict.py" contains the code to forecast disease cases ahead in time based on future climate data (weather forecasts) and a previously trained model read from file. The disease forecasts are stored as a column in a csv file predictions_fn:
```
predict_chap <- function(model_fn, historic_data_fn, future_climatedata_fn, predictions_fn) {
  df <- read.csv(future_climatedata_fn)
  X <- df[, c("rainfall", "mean_temperature"), drop = FALSE]
  model <- readRDS(model_fn)  # Assumes the model was saved using saveRDS

  y_pred <- predict(model, newdata = X)
  df$sample_0 <- y_pred
  write.csv(df, predictions_fn, row.names = FALSE)

  print(paste("Forecasted values:", paste(y_pred, collapse = ", ")))
}

```

## Running the minimalist model as part of CHAP
To run the minimalist model in CHAP, we first define the model interface in an MLFlow-based yaml specification (in the file "MLproject", which defines :

```yaml
name: minimalist_r

docker_env:
  image: ivargr/r_inla:latest

entry_points:
  train:
    parameters:
      train_data: path
      model: str
    command: "Rscript train.R {train_data} {model}"
  predict:
    parameters:
      historic_data: path
      future_data: path
      model: str
      out_file: path
    command: "Rscript predict.R {model} {historic_data} {future_data} {out_file}"
```

CHAP relies on Docker to run models defined in non-python programming languages (i.e. R), you thus need Docker installed to run your model successfully through CHAP. Please see the chap-core documentation for help in succeeding with this.  
After you have installed chap-core (see here for installation instructions: https://github.com/dhis2-chap/chap-core), it should be possible to run the minimalist model through CHAP as follows (remember to replace '/path/to/your/model/directory' with your local path):
```
chap evaluate --model-name /path/to/your/model/directory --dataset-name ISIMIP_dengue_harmonized --dataset-country brazil --report-filename report.pdf
```
